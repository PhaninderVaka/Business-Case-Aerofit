The "Business Case: Aerofit - Descriptive Statistics & Probability" project involved a detailed analysis of treadmill products and their user demographics. Key tasks included importing necessary libraries, analyzing data structures and types, and converting categorical attributes. The project focused on defining the problem statement, conducting non-graphical analysis through value counts and unique attributes, and performing extensive visual analysis. This included distribution plots, count plots, and box plots for both continuous and categorical variables, as well as creating a correlation heatmap and pair plots. The project aimed to understand the target audience for different treadmill types, thereby aiding in effective product recommendations.
